# ARMADILLO 
OBSTACLE AVOIDING CAR

The purpose of our project is to build a robot wall following robot to offer an educational experience for K-12 students.
## Installation 
The minimum programming knowledge needed to program the operations of our product is as follows:

First of all, you need to download the Arduino and install the driver for your laptop/computer/app in order to master the programming part 
To do this type in your browser Arduino.com and go to the [software section](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) select the option your notebook requires (e.g. DOWNLOAD OPTIONS: Win 7 and newer, Windows app Win 8.1 or 10, Linux 32 bits, Mac OS X 10.10 or newer). 

[Web-version of Arduino](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/zhyrgalbekovadiz/b121ed27-0e92-4f0a-b8bf-bedd418a29d0):The Arduino Web Editor allows you to write code and upload sketches to any official Arduino board from your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge). 
If you prefer to use the web version of the Arduino software, follow the requirements below: To do this type in Arduino.com in your browser and go to the web editor. This is all you need to start writing code in the web editor.
## Library

Before uploading the code you have to install the necessary library.
